            "A requirement specification (or requirements specification) in software engineering, is a documentation (usually part of a project description) that identifies the requirements for a software system. "

            "A requirements specification typically includes a detailed description of the system's functional and non-functional requirements, and may also include a set of use cases that describe how the system should respond to particular inputs.\n"
