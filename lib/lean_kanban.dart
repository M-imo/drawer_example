            "Lean and Kanban are two popular techniques for managing work, developed in the software industry to help teams achieve faster, more efficient development cycles. They can be used both separately or in tandem."
            "Lean is a strategy used to identify and eliminate waste – any activity which doesn’t contribute to overall value. "
            "\n"
            "\n"
            "It is based on identifying and measuring the ‘pull’ of customer demand and then structuring activities into smooth production and ‘flow’ based on that pull."
            " This approach encourages cross-functional collaboration as well as continuous improvement via small, iterative steps."
            "Kanban is a visual management system which helps teams plan their work and make sure that their resources are used as efficiently as possible. "
            "\n"
            "\n"
            "It does this by providing visual cues at each step of the process and for each task, which trigger further work or signify the completion of work. Kanban helps teams identify which tasks need to be done and when, as well as making sure that everyone is working with up-to-date information."
            "The combination of Lean and Kanban can yield powerful results as it helps teams map out their current processes, find bottlenecks, break down large tasks into small pieces, and measure progress. "
            "\n"
            "\n"
            "It also helps teams stay organized and proactive, reducing the need for traditional project management tools. Additionally, the visual cues provided by Kanban can help teams identify issues and discrepancies more quickly, allowing faster resolution."
            "Lean and Kanban are powerful strategies for improving efficiency, but implementation requires dedication and a clear understanding of the goals and objectives. "
            "\n"
            "\n"
            "Teams should start by mapping out their current process and identifying any potential bottlenecks. Once the bottle necks are identified, teams should look to further break down their tasks into smaller, achievable goals which can be tracked and monitored. "
            "Lean’s focus on continuous improvement, as well as Kanban’s visual cues, should be embraced and utilized to ensure continual improvement. "
            "\n"
            "\n"
            "Finally, teams should use the data and feedback gathered to adjust the strategy and adjust it again as customer demand shifts. This combination of techniques will ensure teams are always improving and working towards the best outcome for their customer."
